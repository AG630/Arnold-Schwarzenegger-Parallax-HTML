## **Introduction** ## 


Welcome to my project! This is a website designed to inform users about Arnold Schwarzenegger's life, and subsequently offering a fun experience.

In the first initial months of 2023, I started a personal journey of coding software with free available resources, until I discovered a Full-Stack Development course that allowed me to 
work full time and code in my remaining hours of the day. I have previously worked in tech recruitment and really loved that industry. I enjoyed it so much, I found myself appreciating the roles
I was headhunting for more than the developers I was speaking to - probably because their skillset was so in demand and I was one of many recs speaking to them at once.

This project outlines the various modules and languages I have learned so far within HMTL and CSS. I wanted to stand out with this project, and also create something that I have a great interest in as well. I didn't want to create another page that that has a nav-bar re-directing users to external pages. I wanted to create something that still had multiple 'pages' or 'sections' in my case, and could still be directed to various sections of the Parallax. 

Thank you for viewing the website I have coded, I hope you enjoy reading it and interacting with it, as much as I enjoyed creating it!



## **The Planning** ##

What was the goal here with this project?

- The goal was to create a static front end project: writing custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a webiste of at least 3 pages or at least 3 seperate areas. I needed to incorprate a navigation menu and structured layout with it.

What to include in the project?

- Knowing that I could create a project with at least 3 seperate areas/pages. I started off by having the brief in-front of me, and creating the different sections of my website.

- The purpose of the site: to include information about my chosen individual's life, accomplishments, and other things. In addition to this purpose, I wanted the website to feel 'unique' and creative, by maximising CSS capabailities.

## **Planning the user stories** ##

In order to create a good user story experience, I researched user stories and came across a very useful website with some detailed explanations on user stories in Software development: https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/user-stories-in-agile/. This is an article written by Satinder Singh, who says "that stories are expressed in a simple sentence that outlines the desired outcome of a task."

Following Satinder's advice I had to think about the following:

The User: User refers to the end user of the software. Remember that we’re not just after a name or job title. We need to understand who our customers are and what they truly want. We need to have empathy for them.

(Want to): We’re referring to the intent of end users, not the features they use. We need to specify what they’re trying to achieve with the task, not to mention the UI of the app. Otherwise, you’re missing the point.

(So that): Describes the bigger picture. What’s the end goal users are trying to achieve with the feature?

An example he gives looks something like this: "As a startup owner, I want to organize my work in one place so that I feel more in control.

As an HR professional, I want to understand better my colleagues’ progress so that I report our successes and failures".

Who would be viewing my website? Fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger, or individuals carrying out research on him.

What's the intent of the user? The user aim(s) for this particular website, are to extract information about Arnold Schwarzenegger for research purposes. This aim is met with a fun and interactive website to make the user's intent enjoyable to carry out.

The 'So that' part of this equation is to use the data collected for a project to use and present for a school project, fo example. This could also be for personal pleasure but ultimately the purpose is clear, it's for research purposes.

Put together, the user story my user story for this project looks like this: As a user, I want to understand and research Arnold Schwarzenegger so that I can collect data and present the findings for project purposes.

## **User Experience** ##

- The goals for a first time visitor:

- First time users should experience an interactive web page that is easy to navigate and has a great aesthetic.

- They should easily navigate a web-page with ease and scroll through without difficulty.    

- The will be learning more about Arnold Schwarzenegger and taking away more understanding about his life.

- As a returning Visitor i want to be able to easily find information that can be passed on again via a project or casual conversation.

- As a returning visitor i want to be able to easily find contact information for any queries.

## Design

[Colour](<../images/Screenshot 2023-10-12 111425.png>)

- I took the colours from the Homepage background image as this image is both epic and very well designed. I decided to include #E9EFE7, #B77753, #2B2D3B, #434552 AND #29222C.

- Just to outline some of the combinations, I used the colour accessibility checker and got the follow photos:

**Images**
 - The images included feature epic photos of Arnold.
 
 
 ## **The Different Sections of the parallax** ##

Homepage

![Homepage photo](<Screenshot 2023-10-18 153444.png>)

- I had to think through what I needed to have on the homepage.
- The users needed to know what the website is about and I was going to achieve this by selecting a font that I thought was user-friendly, readable, and also stands out.
- I concluded that I needed a navigation bar that could lead me to the various sections of the parallax, as well as an image for the background.
- As the website is a scrolling one, I planned to include the homepage to be set to 'fixed' so that users could refer to it at any section they wish. I also thought it would demonstrate additional CSS capabilities to create a 'Homepage'.
- Users should be presented with a eye-capturing image that would scroll in accordance with the parallax, but also have some organised and easily accessible buttons to jump to other sections of the website.
- Users are provided with hovering animations to make the website more interactive.


Early Life

Actor

- The user of the website, was going to visit the informational pieces of the website on these subsequent sections.
- Having read Arnold's auto biogragphy, I knew what I wanted users to read about him that was interesting, and possibly new. I did additional research just to brush up an specific facts and details around him so that the conent is captivating and would make readers want to read on. 
- As for creative capailities, I wanted to include an interactive experience for the users. But I wanted to create something that included different animations witin each section.
- This took some time to look through various CSS sections on the course and also online.

## **Parallax** ##
- Coding the parallax, and the subsequent sections was relatively straight forward. I had to use CSS to set the display to flex and the flex-direction to column. 
- To create the buffers, I needed to create a white coloured background that included 100% width and a short height too. This was the most straight forward part as the CSS code applied to each buffer, and I didn't need to recreate new rules each time I added in a buffer section.
- Aligning the text boxes, words and additional bits was the trickiest part. The Hompage button needed to be in the top left of the website, no matter what size-screen the user views it on. Parallax pages tend to have their text aligning centrally. As the information is important for users to read, the changes in background images, and hovering effects needed to be there as well.

## **Font Choice and style** ##
- I found the font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;.

This particular font looks bold and strong, and I felt that this reflected the topic of a champion bodybuilder.

The homepage has a selected them of white, red and black for continuity and dynamism. The text really stands out against the homepage image.

When choosing the font of the main informational-text throughout the paralllax, I was deciding on other fonts. Upon researching Parallax pages, I noticed that the size and alignment of text changes a lot throughout the scroll, but the fonts were mainly the same.

## **Image Selection** ##

The images I chose to go with the theme of each section of the parallax varies mostly in timeline and relevancy.

The Early Life section shows a bacground image of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a young child and hovering over the background transitions the image to Arnold winning his first Bodybuilding comp as a teenager. These images have some authentity as they're black and white, and really highlight when they were taken, based on available technology at the time.

On Body building, there are a lot of options to choose from. Arnold is very famous for his body building stages in his career and due to the vast number of choices out there, I thought that including some poses would highlight his achievements.

It was tough to find images of Arnold and Franco Columbo as Brick layers. There are some that users can find themselves, but due to the pixel quality they didn't make for very good background images. Instead I wanted to contrast the colour slightly from the previous section with more black and white images, from the time-period that's described.

Arnold's acting career was a huge one, and selecting dynamic and powerful images were what I was going for in this section. He had a macho-man persona before turning to comedy, and so I wanted to include images of that on screen 'action-man'. As the parallax scrolls, the images become higher in quality, and more recent in chronological order, which was my aim.

## **Issues, bugs and testing** ## 

The part I enjoyed the least about my project, testing the kinks and fixing the bugs!

I didn't really know where to start with this. My mentor @Harry Dhillon at the Code Institue used w3validator in his projects so I thought it was best to follow suit with the W3C CSS Validator(https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

After testing the code and correcting the bugs, I was able to correct the mistakes in my code which presented the final product.

Least to say, there were quite a few errors in my code. A common theme throughout my code, was using the <a> element throughout where I shouldn't have.

Other issues I experienced in this project includes lack of <H1 - H2> as seen on the HTML accessibility checker.

The other issue I experienced with my HTML was the <a> element not following the suit of the <li> element. I decided to remove the list al together, and found I liked the layout of the links without bullet points.

Other Error's I encountered, and had to correct are as follows:

## **Installation** ##

To code my project, I decided to use Microsoft Visual Code Studio. I downloaded the latest version of VCS from a quick Google search, but this I soon realised that this wasn't the end...

I had to use Youtube - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5deeCvboSos&ab_channel=SkillsBuildTraining), to learn how to code my project using HTML, CSS, README and also a live server to test what my site looked like.
